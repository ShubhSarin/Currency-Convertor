# Currency Convertor
## API I used
`https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api`
Reason was that it was always free with unlimited API requests. I depleted the limit of one of the options in the docs just while developing the website :P.
Also if I go with bonus assignment, the api request limit will be depleted in no time so this one is slightly better in that case.

There is one issue that there are a lot of crypto currencies as well which gives a very bad experience.
## HTML and CSS
I know HTML and CSS as I was learning them after the first sem.
I searched almost everything about javascript online, browsed mdn docs and stackoverflow for all the help I need.
I do have some experience of Javascript but I was not so fluent. As of now, I have not added any comments in the code and I will be doing it now as the website is not functional.
That part of the project was fairly east.
## JAVASCRIPT
I almost had to learn it from scratch, the only think I knew was DOMContentLoaded xD.
youtubers like love babbar really helped me, I learned following things -
- Asynch and Await
- Promises
- Changing html through JS
- Objects
- Arrays
and so on..
